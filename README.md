# Git and GitHub CheatSheet
## Create a new repository
From inside a directory in our machine we can create a new repository with the following command
```
git init
```
This will create a directory .git and initialize the repository.

If we already have the respository in GitHub, we can clone it using:
```
git clone repositoryurl
```
